# Experiments
This is the code was used to generate csv files and graphs used in the paper. 

The code has not been modified to be able to run on any computer, so you must alter the code if you want to run thes experiments.

Be mindful that the working directory of each script is changed with the `os.chdir("..")` command. This makes the working directory of the script the same as the root directory of the repository. This is needed as all of these scripts were originally in the root directory of the repository.

Please send an email to danielfaronbi@nyu.edu if you have any questions about how it works.
