# Automatic-Synthesizer-Programing
An attempt to implement self-supervised approach to automatic synthesizer programming.

Current goals:
1)
Select 3 free synthesizers to train the model

2)
test Spiege Lib

3)
Try to understand how to project the synth parameters to a generalized latent space (pool like parameters)
