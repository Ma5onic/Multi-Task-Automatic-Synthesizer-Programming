# Automatic-Synthesizer-Programing
An attempt to implement self-supervised approach to automatic synthesizer programming.

Current goals:
- [ ] Select 3 free synthesizers to train the model
- [ ] test Spiege Lib

- [ ] Try to understand how to project the synth parameters to a generalized latent space (pool like parameters)
